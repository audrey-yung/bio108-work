# Collection of work for Data Science for Conservation Biology class (`# bio108-work`)
This repository contains a Jupiter notebook which one can also execute and follow along with in Google colab that presents a tutorial for performing and analysis on a data set with relevance or ecology or conservation science.

Files in this repository:
* `spatial_data_demo.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that describes how to unzip a zipped folder and analyze the spatial data inside.
* `timeseries_data_demo.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that describes how to access and download data from NOAA's Climate Data Online database and a few ways to visualize the data.
* `bird_diversity_mexico.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that utilizes raw data to practice cleaning up data to conduct simple analyses with.

Folders in this repository:
* `raw-datasets`: A folder to house all files and datasets used in my Jupyter demos.
* `bird-diversity-central-mexico`: A folder to house necessary files for `bird_diveristy_mexico.ipynb`. Data is from [Bird diversity in remnants of deciduous tropical forest in Central Mexico](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QKRK3S)
